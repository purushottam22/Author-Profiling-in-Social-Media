# Author Profiling on Arabic Tweets using Deep Learning Techniques  

In today's world, where many people prefer to hide their identities, **Author Profiling** plays a crucial role in determining an author's characteristics based on their textual data. This project focuses on using Arabic tweets to identify the **gender**, **age**, and **language dialect** of authors.

## Programming Language  
- **Python 3**

---

## Dataset  
We are using the **Train** and **Test** datasets provided by the **Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation (FIRE) 2019** for this research.

---

## Models  
Two models were developed and tested on the dataset to achieve better accuracy and efficiency:

### 1. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Model  
- The first model is a standard **LSTM** network.
- The main file for this model is: `Train_test.py`.

### 2. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) + Features Model  
- The second model combines the **LSTM** network with additional features extracted from the tweets.
- These features include:
  - **Emoji Counter**
  - **Sentence Length**
  - And other relevant characteristics
- The feature extraction programs are located in the `Features` folder.
- The main file for this model is: `Train_test_feature.py`.

### Softmax Layer  
Both models utilize a **Softmax** layer for classification tasks.

## Accuracy  

### Model 1: LSTM  
**Accuracy on Test Data:**  
- **Gender**: 57.64%  
- **Age**: 27.50%  
- **Language Dialect**: 55.14%

### Model 2: LSTM + Features  
**Accuracy on Test Data:**  
- **Gender**: 66.24%  
- **Age**: 22.22%  
- **Language Dialect**: 80.28%
